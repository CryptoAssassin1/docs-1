# Obtain API Key with Authz

🎉 If you don’t want to use your validator operator key to sign a challenge via Keplr, Skip now let’s you sign with <B>any other account!</B>

This requires granting **`MsgVote`** permissions to a different address via `authz`, and then signing with that address. See below.

→ ✅  After completion, go to **[https://skip.money/registration](http://skip.money/registration)** to get an API Key.

## ➡️ Granting `MsgVote` Permissions

```jsx
simd tx authz grant <addr receiving grant> generic --msg-type /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote --from <operator key>
```

- Here, the `msg-type` is the cosmos Type URL of the message that the granter can submit on behalf of the operator
  - This means that the address receiving the `authz` grant **can vote on gov proposals on behalf of your validator** (and sign to get a Skip API Key) contact us and we’ll generate you one.
  - **The address receiving the grant must not have a null pubkey**. In other words, the address you want to sign in with must have signed a transaction before signing the Skip challenge.
- **ICS Chains (Neutron)**: Instead of granting permissions on the ICS chain you will need to grant permissions on Cosmos Hub. You will need to pass an address and the operator key you use on Cosmos Hub.
- If you don’t want to sign a challenge, **[contact us](https://skip.money/contact)** and we’ll generate you an API Key.

## ⬅️ Revoking `MsgVote` Permissions

```jsx
simd tx authz revoke <addr losing grant> /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote --from <operator key>
```

- **Grants can be revoked at any time,** after the grant is revoked the address that received the grant cannot sign in on behalf of your validator anymore
  - This means you can safely temporary delegate permissions to an account, sign the Skip challenge for an API Key, and then revoke the grant.

## 🔍 Querying `MsgVote` Permissions

```jsx
$ simd query authz grants <operator address> <address granted> /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote
```

- Existing grants can be queried from chain state via the above cmd
