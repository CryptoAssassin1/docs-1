It takes just 5 minutes to start using Skip Select to capture MEV with your validator. Even less on chains that include `mev-tendermint` by default.

## Summary of Steps

**Estimated Time**: 5 mins

1. Register as a validator on [skip.money/registration](http://skip.money/registration) to receive an API key
2. Compile your node binaries with `mev-tendermint` (if mev-tendermint is not included in the chain binary by default)
3. Add 3-4 lines of additional config to your nodes
4. Restart your nodes ðŸš€

**Any questions / issues during integration? Ask us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/amAgf9Z39w)**

## Chain IDs that Skip supports:

### Mainnets

- Neutron Mainnet `CHAIN_ID=neutron-1`

### Testnets

- Neutron Testnet `CHAIN_ID=pion-1`

## Chain IDs that include `mev-tendermint` by default

### Mainnets

- Neutron Mainnet `CHAIN_ID=neutron-1`

### Testnets

- Neutron Testnet `CHAIN_ID=pion-1`

## 1. Register âœ…

**ðŸš¨**Â  If you donâ€™t already have an API Key, please get one from the [Skip registration site](https://skip.money/registration).

You will need access to your operator key or a key to which your operator has delegated a `MsgVote` authorization to register. See [these instructions](/docs/select/validator/6-api-key.md) for how to a `MsgVote` authorization if you're not comfortable using your operator key from a browser wallet.

ðŸ’µÂ **After registering, you can also use the Skip web app to configure your MEV payments between you / network stakers on the site.**


## 2. Update config.toml

`mev-tendermint` introduces a new section of config in `config.toml` called `[sidecar]` that includes several
config settings that allow your node to recieve MEV bundles from Skip.

(You can read more about what these are here: [Validator Config Reference Docs](/docs/select/validator/3-config.md))

By the end, the end of your `config.toml` on each node will look something like this (with different string values). **Make sure to include the line `[sidecar]` at the top of this section in `config.toml`.**

```yaml
# OTHER CONFIG...

# EXAMPLE below (please use the correct values)
[sidecar]
sentinel_peer_string = "fakepeerid@fake_network_id-sentinel.skip.money:26656"
sentinel_rpc_string = "http://fake_network_id.skip.money"
api_key = "fake_api_key"
```

- For `api_key`, use the value you obtained by registering for Skip Select in the first step.

- **Find the correct values for sentinel_peer_string and sentinel_rpc_string in the table below:**

  **Mainnets**

  | Chain name      | Chain ID    | Supported Chain Version | sentinel_rpc_string                | sentinel_peer_string                                                           |
  | --------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Neutron Mainnet | `neutron-1` | `v1.0.1`                | `https://neutron-1-api.skip.money` | `08a1653fd6669468f8b9c22d70f476a5b27f576a@neutron-1-sentinel.skip.money:26656` |

  **Testnets**

  | Chain name      | Chain ID  | Supported Chain Version | sentinel_rpc_string              | sentinel_peer_string                                                         |
  | --------------- | --------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Neutron Testnet | `pion-1`  | `v1.0.0-rc1`            | `https://pion-1-api.skip.money`  | `f44aa4467a5c411f650fd9223644d70afc1eacd1@pion-1-sentinel.skip.money:26656`  |

### Extra config for sentry configurations

**Skip this section if you don't use full node sentries, or, equivalently, if you'd like all of your nodes to gossip directly to the sentinel.**

These steps are only relevant for folks with set ups where they want one of their nodes to not peer with the Sentinel (e.g. a full signing node with sentries) and instead receive MEV bundles through an intermediary node (e.g. a sentry node)

- **On the sentry nodes:**

  - Add an **extra line** to the `[sidecar]` config called **`personal_peer_ids`**, and add the node id for your **validator**

  ```yaml
  [sidecar];
  sentinel_peer_string =
    "fake-node-id@fake-network-id-sentinel.skip.money:26656";
  sentinel_rpc_string = "http://fake-network-id-api.skip.money";
  api_key = "fake-api-key";
  personal_peer_ids = "NODEID1,NODEID2, ...";
  ```

  â†’ You can find your node ids by running:

  ```bash
  <NODE_DAEMON> tendermint show-node-id --home <HOME_DIR>

  # example:
  neutrond tendermint show-node-id --home ./neutron
  ```

- **On the validator:**

  - **Remove** the line for `sentinel_peer_string`
  - **Remove** the line for `sentinel_rpc_string`
  - **Remove** the line for `api_key`
  - Add an **extra line** to the `[sidecar]` config called **`personal_peer_ids`**, and add the node ids for your **sentry nodes**

  ```jsx
  [sidecar];
  personal_peer_ids = "NODEID1,NODEID2, ...";
  ```

  â†’ You can find your node ids by running:

  ```jsx
  <NODE_DAEMON> tendermint show-node-id --home <HOME_DIR>

  # example:
  neutrond tendermint show-node-id --home ./neutron
  ```

---

## 4. Restart your node ðŸš€

**Thatâ€™s it!** You should now begin receiving MEV bundles and higher rewards from Skip âœ…

**If you use Cosmovisor, make sure to point it to the new binary**

**Run `curl -sL localhost:26657/status | jq .result.mev_info` to check if you are connected**

- If things are working correctly you should see this:

  ```jsx
  {
    "is_peered_with_sentinel": true,
    "last_received_bundle_height": "0"
  }
  ```

- **Troubleshooting**: If you aren't receiving the expected output, please visit the [troubleshooting page](/docs/select/validator/1-troubleshooting.md) or get in touch with Skip team for assistance.

- **Monitoring:** mev-tendermint exposes new Prometheus metrics under the "mev" namespace in tendermint.
  The most important metric is `mev_sentinel_connected`, which is 1 if your node is able to receive MEV transactions
  from Skip, and 0 otherwise. Check out [this page](/docs/select/validator/2-monitoring.md) for more information on monitoring and alerting solutions

### Handling Chain Upgrades

Skip does not make chain upgrades more complex.

Simply follow the instructions from [step 2 above](#2-compile-your-node-with-mev-tendermint) each time you need to upgrade a node, using the new `$CHAIN_VERSION-mev` tag.
