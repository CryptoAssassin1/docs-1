:::info TLDR

The `MEV Lane` hosts top of block auctions in protocol and verifiably builds blocks with top-of-block block space reserved for auction winners, with auction revenue being redistributed to chains.

:::

### üí∞ Overview

Blockspace is valuable, and MEV bots find arbitrage opportunities to capture value. The Block SDK provides a fair auction for these opportunities via the `x/auction` module inside the Block SDK so that protocols are rewarded while ensuring that users are not front-run or sandwiched in the process.

The Block SDK uses the app-side mempool, `PrepareLane` / `ProcessLane`, and `CheckTx` to create an MEV marketplace inside the protocol. It introduces a new message type, called a `MsgAuctionBid`, that allows the submitter to execute multiple transactions at the **top of the block atomically** (atomically = directly next to each other). Read more [here](mev-integration)

<!-- TODO: What do we do about searcher docs @mag -->

This means that ‚Äòsearchers‚Äô can find opportunities in the mempool, backrun them, and submit them at the top of the block. This covers most MEV recapture via arbitrage and liquidations. It can be configured to **not allow** for sandwich attacks or harmful MEV.

Skip's Block SDK provides developers with a set of a few core MEV primitives:

- `x/builder`: This Cosmos SDK module gives applications the ability to process
  MEV bundled transactions in addition to having the ability to define how searchers
  and block proposers are rewarded. In addition, the module defines a `AuctionDecorator`,
  which is an AnteHandler decorator that enforces various chain configurable MEV
  rules.
- `Proposal Handlers`: This ABCI++ handler defines `PrepareLane` and `ProcessLane`
  methods that give applications the ability to perform top-of-block auctions,
  which enables recapturing, redistributing and control over MEV. These methods
  are responsible for block proposal construction and validation.
- `AuctionMempool`: An MEV-aware mempool that enables searchers to submit bundled
  transactions to the mempool and have them bundled into blocks via a top-of-block
  auction. Searchers include a bid in their bundled transactions and the highest
  bid wins the auction. Application devs have control over levers that control
  aspects such as the bid floor and minimum bid increment.
- `CheckTxHandler`: This handler defines a `CheckTx` method that gives
  applications the ability to perform MEV-aware transaction validation. Without
  the ability to validate bids as if they were to be executed first on the latest committed
  state, auctions can be grieved and MEV can be stolen.

**At a high level, to integrate MEV chains must:**

1. Be using Cosmos SDK version or higher `v0.47.0`.
2. Add the `x/builder` module to their set of SDK modules.
3. Import and configure the POB mempool into their base app.
4. Import and configure the POB `Prepare` / `Process` proposal handlers into their base app.
5. Import and configure the POB `CheckTx` handler into their base app.
6. Configure the desired auction parameters (including an address such as the community pool that will accrue auction fees).
7. **[Optional]** The `AuctionFactory` is in charge of determining how searchers bid for top of block execution and how to extract relevant bid information (transactions, timeout, etc.). Chains can configure their own implementations to have [unique auction flows](https://github.com/skip-mev/pob/blob/main/SPEC#configuration).

### Release Compatibility Matrix

| Block SDK Version | Cosmos SDK |
| :---------------: | :--------: |
|      v1.x.x       |  v0.47.x   |

**The following sections will walk through each of these steps in detail.**

### Cosmos SDK Version

The Block SDK requires Cosmos SDK version `v0.47.0` or higher. This is because Block SDK uses the `ABCI++` interface, which was introduced in `v0.47.0`. If your chain is using a lower version, you will need to upgrade to `v0.47.0` or higher. You can find the latest version of the Cosmos SDK [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases).

### Base App Configuration

#### Install

```shell
$ go install github.com/skip-mev/block-sdk
```

1. Import the necessary dependencies into your application. This includes the
   proposal + checkTx handlers, mempool, keeper, builder types, and builder module. This
   tutorial will go into more detail into each of the dependencies.

   ```go
   import (
     "github.com/skip-mev/block-sdk/block"
     "github.com/skip-mev/block-sdk/block/abci"
     "github.com/skip-mev/block-sdk/x/builder"
     builderkeeper "github.com/skip-mev/block-sdk/x/builder/keeper"
     buildertypes "github.com/skip-mev/block-sdk/x/builder/types"
     ...
   )
   ```

2. Add your module to the the `AppModuleBasic` manager. This manager is in
   charge of setting up basic, non-dependent module elements such as codec
   registration and genesis verification. This will register the special
   `MsgAuctionBid` message. When users want to bid for top of block execution,
   they will submit a transaction - which we call an **auction transaction** - that
   includes a single `MsgAuctionBid`. We prevent any other messages from being
   included in auction transaction to prevent malicious behavior - such as front
   running or sandwiching.

   ```go
   var (
     ModuleBasics = module.NewBasicManager(
       ...
       builder.AppModuleBasic{},
     )
     ...
   )
   ```

3. The builder `Keeper` is MEV Lanes's gateway to processing special **auction transactions** that allow users to participate in the top of block auction, distribute revenue to the auction house, and ensure the validity of auction transactions.

   a. First add the keeper to the app's struct definition alongside the checkTx handler.

   ```go
   type App struct {
     ...
     // BuilderKeeper is the keeper that handles processing auction transactions
     BuilderKeeper         builderkeeper.Keeper

     // Custom checkTx handler
     checkTxHandler abci.CheckTx
   }
   ```

   b. Add the builder module to the list of module account permissions. This will instantiate the builder module account on genesis.

   ```go
   maccPerms = map[string][]string{
     builder.ModuleName: nil,
     ...
   }
   ```

   c. Instantiate the builder keeper, store keys, and module manager. Note, be sure to do this after all the required keeper dependencies have been instantiated.

   ```go
   keys := storetypes.NewKVStoreKeys(
     buildertypes.StoreKey,
     ...
   )

   ...
   app.BuilderKeeper := builderkeeper.NewKeeper(
     appCodec,
     keys[buildertypes.StoreKey],
     app.AccountKeeper,
     app.BankKeeper,
     app.DistrKeeper,
     app.StakingKeeper,
     authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govv1.ModuleName).String(),
   )

    app.ModuleManager = module.NewManager(
      builder.NewAppModule(appCodec, app.BuilderKeeper),
      ...
    )
   ```

   d. Searchers bid to have their bundles executed at the top of the block using `MsgAuctionBid` messages (by default). While the builder `Keeper` is capable of tracking valid bids, it is unable to correctly sequence the auction transactions alongside the normal transactions without having access to the application‚Äôs mempool. As such, we have to instantiate the MEV lane's custom `AuctionMempool` - a modified version of the SDK‚Äôs priority sender-nonce mempool - into the application.

   Application developers can choose to implement their own `AuctionFactory` implementation or use the default implementation provided by POB. The `AuctionFactory` is responsible for determining what is an auction bid transaction and how to extract the bid information from the transaction. The default implementation provided by POB is `DefaultAuctionFactory` which uses the `MsgAuctionBid` message to determine if a transaction is an auction bid transaction and extracts the bid information from the message.

   ```go
      tobConfig := blockbuster.BaseLaneConfig{
        Logger:        app.Logger(),
        TxEncoder:     app.txConfig.TxEncoder(),
        TxDecoder:     app.txConfig.TxDecoder(),
        MaxBlockSpace: math.LegacyZeroDec(), // Set the percentage of block space that the lane should consume.
      }
      tobLane := auction.NewTOBLane(
        tobConfig,
        0, // Set the maximum number of bids that can be stored.
        auction.NewDefaultAuctionFactory(app.txConfig.TxDecoder()),
      )

      // Set the lanes into the mempool.
      lanes := []blockbuster.Lane{
        tobLane,
        ...
      }
      mempool := blockbuster.NewMempool(lanes...)
      app.App.SetMempool(mempool)

   ```

   e. With Cosmos SDK version 0.47.0, the process of building blocks has been updated and moved from the consensus layer, CometBFT, to the application layer. When a new block is requested, the proposer for that height will utilize the `PrepareProposal` handler to build a block while the `ProcessProposal` handler will verify the contents of the block proposal by all validators. The combination of the `AuctionMempool`, `PrepareLane` and `ProcessLane` handlers of the MEV lane allows the application to verifiably build valid blocks with top-of-block block space reserved for auctions.

   Additionally, we override the `BaseApp`'s `CheckTx` handler with our own custom `CheckTx` handler that will be responsible for checking the validity of transactions. We override the `CheckTx` handler so that we can verify auction transactions before they are inserted into the mempool on top of the latest commit state. This is important because we otherwise there may be discrepencies between how the auction transaction and the bundled transactions are validated in `CheckTx` and `PrepareLane` such that the auction can be griefed. All other transactions will be executed with base app's `CheckTx`.

   ```go
    // Create the entire chain of AnteDecorators for the application.
    anteDecorators := []sdk.AnteDecorator{
      auction.NewAuctionDecorator(
        app.BuilderKeeper,
        txConfig.TxEncoder(),
        mempool,
      ),
      ...,
    }

    // Create the antehandler that will be used to check transactions throughout the lifecycle
    // of the application.
    anteHandler := sdk.ChainAnteDecorators(anteDecorators...)
    app.SetAnteHandler(anteHandler)

    // Set the lane config on the lanes.
    for _, lane := range lanes {
      lane.SetAnteHandler(anteHandler)
    }
    app.App.SetAnteHandler(anteHandler)

    // Create the proposal handler that will be used to build and validate blocks.
    handler := proposalhandler.NewProposalHandler(
      mempool,
      bApp.Logger(),
      anteHandler,
      txConfig.TxEncoder(),
      txConfig.TxDecoder(),
    )
    app.SetPrepareProposal(handler.PrepareProposalHandler())
    app.SetProcessProposal(handler.ProcessProposalHandler())

    // Set the custom CheckTx handler on BaseApp.
    checkTxHandler := abci.NewCheckTxHandler(
      app.App,
      app.txConfig.TxDecoder(),
      tobLane,
      anteHandler,
    )
    app.SetCheckTx(checkTxHandler.CheckTx())

    ...

    // CheckTx will check the transaction with the provided checkTxHandler. We override the default
    // handler so that we can verify bid transactions before they are inserted into the mempool.
    // With the MEV lane's CheckTx, we can verify the bid transaction and all of the bundled transactions
    // before inserting the bid transaction into the mempool.
    func (app *TestApp) CheckTx(req *cometabci.RequestCheckTx) (*cometabci.ResponseCheckTx, error) {
      return app.checkTxHandler(req)
    }

    // SetCheckTx sets the checkTxHandler for the app.
    func (app *TestApp) SetCheckTx(handler abci.CheckTx) {
      app.checkTxHandler = handler
    }
   ```

   f. Finally, update the app's `InitGenesis` order.

   ```go
   genesisModuleOrder := []string{
     buildertypes.ModuleName,
     ...,
   }
   ```
