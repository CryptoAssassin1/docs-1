:::info TLDR

The `MEV Lane` allows top-of-block MEV auctions in-protocol, revenue being redistributed to chains.

If you have not already, we recommend following the [General Setup](/docs/chains/0-integrate-the-sdk.md) guide first!

### üí∞ Overview

Blockspace is valuable, and MEV bots find arbitrage opportunities to capture value. The `MEV Lane` provides a fair auction for these by leveraging the `x/builder` module inside the Block SDK. The `MEV Lane` ensures protocols are recapturing their value while ensuring users are not front-run or sandwiched in the process.

The Block SDK uses the app-side `LanedMempool`, `PrepareLane` / `ProcessLane`, and `CheckTx` to create an MEV marketplace inside the protocol. It introduces a new message type, called a `MsgAuctionBid`, that allows the submitter to execute multiple transactions at the **top of the block atomically** (atomically = directly next to each other).

This means that ‚Äòsearchers‚Äô can find opportunities in the mempool, backrun them, and submit them at the top of the block. This covers most MEV recapture via arbitrage and liquidations. It can be configured to **not allow** for sandwich attacks or harmful MEV.

### üìñ Set Up [10 mins]

**At a high level, to integrate the MEV Lane, chains must:**

1. Be using Cosmos SDK version or higher `v0.47.0`.
2. Import and configure the `MEV Lane` (alongside any other desired lanes) into their base app.
3. Import and configure the Block SDK mempool into their base app.
4. Import and configure the Block SDK `Prepare` / `Process` proposal handlers into their base app.
5. Import and instantiate the `x/builder` module into their base app.
